Question: How does the NEF support traffic influence procedures and what roles do the Policy Control?


--- Response ---
The NEF supports Traffic Influence procedures by providing a means for the AF (Application Function) to manage and influence network traffic. The specific details of this procedure are not explicitly stated in the provided context, but it is mentioned that the NEF translates information received from the AF to the one sent to internal 3GPP NFs.

Regarding Policy Control, the context mentions that the NEF may support a PFD (Policy and Charging Function) function which allows the AF to provision PFD(s) and store/retrieve them in the UDR. However, there is no explicit mention of the role of Policy Control in Traffic Influence procedures.
