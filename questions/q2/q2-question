Q: How does the NEF support traffic influence procedures and what roles do the Policy Control Function (PCF) and Binding Support Function (BSF) play in this context?

A: The NEF supports traffic influence procedures by allowing the AF to create, update, and delete traffic influence subscriptions through RESTful APIs. When the AF sends a traffic influence request for an individual UE, the NEF may interact with the BSF to retrieve related PCF information and then interact with the PCF using the NpcfPolicyAuthorization service. The PCF is responsible for policy authorization related to the traffic influence, while the BSF aids in discovering the appropriate PCF address. This interaction ensures that traffic influence subscriptions are authorized and managed properly for individual UEs or multiple UEs.
