Question: What is the Network Exposure Function (NEF) in 5G systems?


--- Response ---
The Network Exposure Function (NEF) is a functional element that supports securely exposing network capabilities and events provided by 3GPP NFs to Application Functions (AF). It acts as an intermediary between AF and internal 3GPP NFs, translating information received from the AF to be sent to internal 3GPP NFs and vice versa. The NEF is responsible for authenticating, authorizing, and assisting in throttling AF requests.
