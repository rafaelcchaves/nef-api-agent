Q: Describe the detailed data model and interaction flow involved in creating and managing an individual traffic influence subscription via the NEF Northbound Interface, including the roles of HTTP methods and associated data structures.

A: An individual traffic influence subscription is managed through the NEF Northbound Interface using specific RESTful APIs with various HTTP methods: POST to create, GET to read, PUT/PATCH to update, and DELETE to remove subscriptions. The traffic influence subscription resource is identified by a URI containing the AF identifier and a NEF-generated subscription ID. The POST request includes a data structure of type TrafficInfluSub, which specifies parameters such as afServiceId, dnn, snssai, subscribedEvents, traffic filters, and notification configurations. Upon receiving a valid POST request from an authorized AF, the NEF interacts with the BSF to discover the PCF, then utilizes the PCF's NpcfPolicyAuthorization service for policy checks. If successful, the NEF creates the subscription, returning a 201 Created status with a Location header containing the subscription URI. PATCH requests allow partial updates with TrafficInfluSubPatch structures, while PUT replaces the entire subscription resource. DELETE requests remove the subscription and return a 204 No Content status. Notifications about UP management events related to these subscriptions are sent by the NEF to the AF via HTTP POST or WebSocket, using the EventNotification structure. This data model and flow ensure secure, authorized, and fine-grained control over traffic influence in the 5G network.
