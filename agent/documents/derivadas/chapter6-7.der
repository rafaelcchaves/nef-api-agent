Security

To ensure robust and standardized secure communication between the Network Exposure Function (NEF) and the Application Function (AF), the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) as specified in IETF RFC 5246 is mandated for the NEF Northbound interface, in accordance with the guidance provided in subclause 12 of 3GPP TS 33.501. This mechanism establishes a secure channel that guarantees data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity during the exchange of information across network functions. In scenarios where the Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF) northbound APIs are utilized, access control and authorization must be implemented through the OAuth 2.0 protocol, as standardized in IETF RFC 6749, relying specifically on the Client Credentials authorization grant type. Under this scheme, the client entity—acting as the AF—must first obtain an access token from an authorization server prior to initiating any service request toward the NEF Northbound APIs. This token-based approach enables policy-driven access governance and fosters interoperability across heterogeneous service domains.

Using Common API Framework

7.1

General

When the Common API Framework (CAPIF) is employed in conjunction with an NEF that facilitates external service exposure, the NEF is required to support a comprehensive suite of CAPIF functionalities as specified in 3GPP TS 29.222. Specifically, it shall implement the API exposing function and its associated interfaces via the CAPIF-2/2e and CAPIF-3 reference points, the API publishing function using the CAPIF-4 reference point, and the API management function through the CAPIF-5 reference point. Furthermore, the NEF must support at least one standardized method for authentication and authorization, including its corresponding security mechanisms, to ensure a consistent trust model across all API interactions. In contexts where a centralized CAPIF deployment—as detailed in 3GPP TS 23.222—co-locates the CAPIF core function with the API provider domain functions, intra-domain communication may proceed without explicit reliance on the CAPIF-3, CAPIF-4, or CAPIF-5 reference points, thereby optimizing performance and reducing signaling overhead.

7.2

Security

For scenarios involving external exposure through CAPIF, security negotiation between the AF, acting as the API invoker, and the CAPIF core function constitutes a prerequisite to any API invocation. This negotiation process encompasses the selection among Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), TLS with Pre-Shared Keys (TLS-PSK), or OAuth 2.0 as the security protocol, as outlined in subclauses 5.6.2.2 and 6.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.222. The chosen method determines the authentication framework and credential exchange procedures ensuring that the NEF possesses sufficient authority to validate AF identity. Should PKI or TLS-PSK be employed, the NEF must subsequently retrieve the relevant authorization information from the CAPIF core function as prescribed in subclause 5.6.2.4 of the same specification, facilitating a verifiable chain of trust and secure credential validation.

As specified in 3GPP TS 33.122, OAuth 2.0 authentication, particularly the Client Credentials authorization grant, may alternatively govern access to NEF northbound APIs, with the CAPIF core function assuming the operational role of an authorization server. It is important to note that, within the release under discussion, the Client Credentials grant type represents the sole supported method for access delegation. When OAuth 2.0 is employed, the AF must invoke the Obtain_Authorization service to acquire an access token before consuming services offered by the NEF northbound APIs, in accordance with the implementation details set forth in 3GPP TS 29.222, subclause 5.6.2.3.2. The NEF, in turn, evaluates this token to ascertain whether the AF is authorized to access the targeted API. Given that the NEF northbound APIs do not define explicit OAuth scopes, it remains the NEF’s responsibility to perform contextual authorization checks. These checks entail verifying that the NEF identifier within the token corresponds to its registered identifier and that the API name specified aligns with its published nomenclature. Upon successful validation, the AF is granted full authorization to perform any associated operation or resource access defined within the invoked API. In all cases, admission control policies must subsequently be applied by the NEF following the completion of token-based authorization, ensuring alignment with operator-defined access policies and maintaining system-wide security compliance.
