NEF Northbound APIs
5.1 Introduction

The NEF Northbound Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) constitute a standardized set of interfaces defining the operational procedures and resource models that facilitate bidirectional interaction between the Network Exposure Function (NEF) and the Application Function (AF). These APIs serve a pivotal role in enabling external applications to securely and efficiently access network capabilities, orchestrate service communication patterns, and influence data flows within both Evolved Packet System (EPS) and 5G System (5GS) environments.
5.2 Information Applicable to Several APIs

The NEF Northbound APIs adhere to the conventions of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for communication and define content formats consistent with the specifications in subclauses 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.122. Consequently, HTTP serves as the transport mechanism upon which service visibility, resource manipulation, and state synchronization depend.

Furthermore, key operational mechanisms including notification handling, error management, feature negotiation, and HTTP custom header utilization are governed by the rules defined in subclauses 5.2.5 through 5.2.8 of 3GPP TS 29.122. However, in this specification, the SCEF (Service Capability Exposure Function) has been superseded by the NEF, and the SCS/AS has been replaced by the AF to reflect the architecture of the 5GS service exposure framework.

Similarly, the conventions guiding the OpenAPI specification files, as set forth in subclause 5.2.10 of 3GPP TS 29.122, are fully applicable to the NEF Northbound APIs to ensure alignment with industry standards and facilitate interoperability across vendors.
5.3 Reused APIs

This clause enumerates the northbound APIs that retain applicability across both EPS and 5GS domains, demonstrating backward compatibility while allowing system evolution.

Table 5.3.1‑1: Reused APIs applicable for both EPS and 5GS
API Name	Differences
ResourceManagementOfBdt	The feature LocBdt_5G, as described in subclause 5.4.4 of 3GPP TS 29.122, may only be supported in 5G due to its dependency on advanced 5G network topology awareness.
PfdManagement	—
MonitoringEvent	The feature Number_of_UEs_in_an_area_notification_5G, specified in subclause 5.3.4, is exclusive to 5G to support enhanced network analytics.
DeviceTriggering	The feature ExpectedUMT_5G, defined in subclause 5.10.4, may only be supported in 5G to enable predictive network behavior modeling.
CpProvisioning	The feature EthChgParty_5G, as defined in subclause 5.5.4, may only be supported in 5G. In addition, bearer-related events such as LOSS_OF_BEARER, RECOVERY_OF_BEARER, and RELEASE_OF_BEARER are not applicable in the 5G architecture.
ChargeableParty	—
AsSessionWithQoS	The feature EthAsSessionQoS_5G, as described in subclause 5.14.4, may only be supported in 5G. Bearer-based events present in EPS do not apply to 5G, reflecting the shift to QoS flows under the Service-Based Architecture (SBA).
5.4 Traffic Influence API
5.4.1 Resources
5.4.1.1 Overview

This subclause specifies the hierarchical structure of Resource Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) and describes the resource elements and HTTP methods available for the Traffic Influence API. The Traffic Influence API allows an AF to interact with the NEF to manage traffic routing policies dynamically, thereby influencing User Plane (UP) path selection for application-optimized service delivery.

As depicted by the resource URI structure {apiRoot}/3gpp-traffic-influence/v1/{afId}/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}, the API supports lightweight, RESTful operations through standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) for creating, reading, updating, and deleting traffic influence subscription resources. Each method is explicitly associated with expected request and response data models, HTTP status codes, and compliance with 3GPP-defined error-handling conventions.
5.4.1.2 Resource: Traffic Influence Subscription

This resource enables an AF to query and manage all active traffic influence subscriptions associated with its identifier. The AF interacts via HTTP methods to retrieve, instantiate, or modify subscription objects managed by the NEF, thereby enabling controlled exposure of network functions that govern routing influences. These interactions facilitate fine-grained customization of how traffic paths are resolved based on predefined policies, device context, or service-level objectives.
5.4.1.3 Resource: Individual Traffic Influence Subscription

Through individual resource endpoints, an AF can register and modify specific traffic influence subscriptions. Each subscription instance encapsulates a set of parameters that dictate how data traffic should be routed based on contextual and temporal factors. The use of PUT and PATCH methods enables both complete replacement and partial modification of existing configuration attributes, while DELETE operations allow termination of subscription lifecycles. This mechanism ensures that applications can dynamically align their data routing behaviors with evolving network conditions and service requirements.
5.4.2 Notifications

Notifications represent a fundamental event-driven feature of the NEF–AF interaction model. Upon detection of a User Plane management event by the Session Management Function (SMF), the NEF issues an HTTP POST notification to the AF to report the corresponding state change, such as a change in Distributed Network Access Identifier (DNAI). This real-time signaling ensures that the AF maintains an accurate representation of underlying network topologies and data flow routes.

Alternatively, if both the NEF and AF support WebSocket-based communication, notifications may be delivered through a persistent WebSocket session to improve efficiency and minimize latency, as defined in subclause 5.2.5.4 of 3GPP TS 29.122.
5.4.3 Data Model

The Traffic Influence API defines a comprehensive data model that structures how traffic influence attributes are represented, exchanged, and persisted. The model reuses multiple data types standardized in other 3GPP specifications to ensure interoperability across service management components and maintain semantic coherence across systems.

Complex structured types such as TrafficInfluSub, TrafficInfluSubPatch, and EventNotification encapsulate policy attributes, event details, and operational metadata relevant to traffic routing and notification management. These types include hierarchical elements that specify address endpoints (IPv4/IPv6), flow descriptors, temporal validity intervals, and notification destinations.

Simple data types and enumerations, including SubscribedEvent, support system-level consistency by establishing clearly-defined operational states and event triggers. Notably, the enumeration UP_PATH_CHANGE reflects AF interest in changes to the UP path configuration—a critical feature in SDN-style control over dynamic data routing.
5.4.4 Used Features

The Traffic Influence API supports optional features negotiated between the NEF and AF to optimize network exposure capabilities. Two primary features are defined: Notification_websocket, enabling notification delivery over WebSocket connections, and Notification_test_event, allowing validation of event delivery mechanisms through test notifications. Support for these features ensures robust communication and facilitates automated verification of exposure interfaces during integration.
